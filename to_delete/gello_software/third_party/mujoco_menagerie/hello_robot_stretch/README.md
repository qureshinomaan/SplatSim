## URDF â†’ MJCF derivation steps

1. Processed `.obj` files with [`obj2mjcf`](https://github.com/kevinzakka/obj2mjcf).
2. Added `<mujoco> <compiler discardvisual="false" fusestatic="false" balanceinertia="true"/> </mujoco>` to the URDF's
   `<robot>` clause in order to preserve visual geometries.
3. Loaded the URDF into MuJoCo and saved a corresponding MJCF.
4. Manually edited the MJCF to extract common properties into the `<default>` section.
5. Added actuators.
6. Added <exclude> clauses to prevent collisions in the telescoping arm.
7. Added `scene.xml` which includes the robot, with a textured groundplane, skybox, and haze.
