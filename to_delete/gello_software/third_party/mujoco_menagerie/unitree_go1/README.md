## URDF â†’ MJCF derivation steps

1. Manually edited the MJCF to extract common properties into the `<default>` section.
2. Manually designed collision geometries.
3. Softened the contacts of the feet to approximate the effect of rubber and
   increased `impratio` to reduce slippage.
4. Added `scene.xml` which includes the robot, with a textured groundplane, skybox, and haze.
