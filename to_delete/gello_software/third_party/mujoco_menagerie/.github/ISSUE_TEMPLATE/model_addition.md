If you would like to see a new model added to the Menagerie collection, please provide us with the following information _before_ sending a pull request. (Ideally, before you start working on converting or tuning the model for MuJoCo.)

**URL for the existing model source (e.g. URDF)**

**License terms of the upstream model**

**What do you think is required to convert and tune this model for MuJoCo?**

**Are you proposing to help develop and maintain the new model?**
