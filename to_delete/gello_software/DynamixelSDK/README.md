## Dynamixel SDK
The ROBOTIS Dynamixel SDK is a software development kit that provides Dynamixel control functions using packet communication. The API is designed for Dynamixel actuators and Dynamixel-based platforms. For more information on Dynamixel SDK, please refer to the e-manual below.
- [ROBOTIS e-Manual for Dynamixel SDK](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/software/dynamixel/dynamixel_sdk/overview/)

## Supported Programming Languages
DynamixelSDK supports various programming languages.
- **C**: *Dynamic library and source code of this library and examples
- **C#** / **Java** / **MATLAB** / **LabVIEW**: Support based on dynamic library using C language
- **C++**: *Dynamic library and source code of this library and examples
- **Python**: Python module and examples
(* Dynamic library (*.dll, *.so, and *.dylib files) / .dll: dynamic-link library on Windows / .so: shared object on Linux / .dylib: dynamic library on MacOS)
